I wanted to see what the patterns of available bikes are at a particular Citibike station. I didn't see this historic data available on the [Citibike Data Site](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), so I am going to collect a bit to analyze.

After I look at one station, I might capture some data for the whole sytem (if it seems like it would be something interesting to explore).
